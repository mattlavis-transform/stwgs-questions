          There are 4 measures on this commodity that are all potentially suited
          to additional questions, as each of them has a single 'certificate' and a 
          single 'waiver' associated with it.<br><br>

          There are 4 measures on this commodity, only 2 of which are suited to
          additional questions: the other two (animal health certificate and veterinary control)
          are overly simple and complex respectively.
